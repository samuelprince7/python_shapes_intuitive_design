Python Turtle: Fascinating Shapes based on intuitive & instinctual design

These are some of the 1st lines of code that I wrote that initiated a genuine love 
for the Python Programming language. Specifically, how altering 
'degree angles' by even, odd, prime, or re-current number patterns produces significantly 
aesthetically pleasing results. 
(try updating 'degrees to 33' for "i in range 333", or 'degrees to 17' for "i in range 777"), etc..
...while there is 'definite purpose' within mathematical calculations, there is also very much an art within mathematics...
